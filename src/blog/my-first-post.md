## Hello

My name is Mike and for the better part of the last year I've been thinking about starting a blog. There were a lot of things leading up to that, such as:

- My wife and I welcoming our son Zane into the world last July
- My decision to leave a job of 13 years about a month after Zane was born
- The three month sabbatical I took between that job and my current position with Zumasys
- That new position with Zumasys opening my eyes to many new technologies

So I guess you could say it was all Zane's fault.

I don't know how often I'll write. I don't know if I'll write anything good. I don't know if anyone will read this. Before I invest too much in putting pen to paper, I'll probably spend a bit more time learning the tech that drives this (shout out [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) and [@bencodezen](https://github.com/bencodezen)). I'm a huge fan of Vue.js and use it a lot professionally but have been waiting for the right thing to tap into it for personally, so here we go.
