# Mike's Blog

Thanks on this goes to [@bencodezen](https://github.com/bencodezen/vuepress-blog-boilerplate.git)! This blog is an implementation of his boilerplate for [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org). As it so happens, this is also hosted in [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/itsxallwater/itsxallwater.github.io).

## Hat Tip

Kudos to Ben on this writeup. For those familiar with the [Vue.js](https://www.vuejs.org) ecosystem, you might be reminded of [Chris Fritz's](https://www.twitter.com/chrisvfritz) [Vue Enterprise Boilerplate](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate) and you would be absolutely right. I thought the concept was brilliant and wanted to do something similar for the [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) ecosystem since blogging is something that still requires a fair amount of configuration and knowledge in order to get started.

And in case you didn't know, Chris Fritz is one of the core contributors to the incredible [Vue.js docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) that we all love so much. So if you would like to help support him so he can spend more time on creating awesome content for the Vue.js community, please support him by [becoming a sponsor on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/chrisvuefritz).
